# PERfECT API



[中文](README_CN.md)

> This is a API introduction for PERfECT system.

## Introduction

[PERfECT](https://github.com/WISE-PERfECT/PERfECT) The world's first and best ECT control system.

Electrical Chemical Transistor (ECT) is a special type of transistor that has a totally different work mechanism compared with traditional Si-based transistors. Essentially, this kind of transistor is playing more with ions but not electrons, which makes it more similar to a human neural (both sensing and computing) system.

PERfECT start from a project called 'Personalized Electrical Reader for Electrical Chemical Transistors' which aims to prototype the world's first characterization system specifically for ECT devices, with our 10 years of dedication to it.
