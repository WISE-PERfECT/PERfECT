The world's first and best ECT control system.

Electrical Chemical Transistor (ECT) is a special type of transistor that has a totally different work mechanism compared with traditional Si-based transistors. Essentially, this kind of transistor is playing more with ions but not electrons, which makes it more similar to a human neural (both sensing and computing) system.

PERfECT start from a project called 'Personalized Electrical Reader for Electrical Chemical Transistors' which aims to prototype the world's first characterization system specifically for ECT devices, with our 10 years of dedication to it.
