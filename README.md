# PERfECT
The world's first and best ECT control system.

Electrical Chemical Transistor (ECT) is a special type of transistor that has a totally different work mechanism compared with traditional Si-based transistors. Essencialy, this kind of transistor is playing more with ions but not electrons, which makes it more similar to human nueral (both sensing and computing) system.

PERfECT start from a project called 'Personalized Electrical Reader for Electrical Chemical Transistors' which aim to prototype the world first characterizaion system specifically for ECT devices, with our 10 years dedication on it.
